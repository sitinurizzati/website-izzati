<center><p><h2><strong>My Unforgotten Experience in my life </strong></h2></strong></center>

<p1>	The most unforgotten experience in my life is when I know that I can further my study in UiTM Machang. I would be a student at UiTM Machang. My mother and sister are very delighted when they know that I can further my study. My mother very grateful because I can further my study nearby my village which is Kota Bharu. My family does not come from wealthy family. Getting an offer to further my studies nearby my hometown was a very meaningful gift for me and my family. Machang is only 40km from my hometown, this means that I always can come back home to take care of my mother.</p1>

<p2>	After I have received the offer, my family and I was very busy pereparing my stuff. My mother was the one that always worry if I did not plan thing early because I am a clumsy girl. I have to spend many money in order to prepare everything that is needed when I go to Machang. I use my own money because after STPM, I have worked at an association in Kota Bharu as a clerk. I also apply PTPTN loan to support my study because my mother does have enough moeny to pay my fee. </p2>

<p3>	On the day for the registration, I felt so nervous and scared. When I reached at UiTM Machang gate, I am so amazed with the beauty garden that UiTM have in front of the gate. My mother, big sister and little brother also follow mw to UiTM Machang. I registered into my dorm, my room number DO2/121. It is a simple room with one double decker bed and one single bed. In this room, I met my new friends which is Mawaddah and Khalida. Accidently, they are the same course with me. I felt so grateful. From that moment, I know that my new journey has come. I would gain so many knowledge at here and would come home with a degree so that my mother would be proud of me.</p3>
